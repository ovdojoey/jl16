<p class="home-tagline">When designing this website, I ran into a problem where I needed to order something differently on mobile. It was the blue ribbon on the <a href="/blog">blog</a> page.</p>

<p class="home-tagline">Ordering content differently across multiple screen sizes can be problematic.
  When using a grid framework it can be done with column pushes and pulls &mdash; but those feel hacky. You can change up your HTML source order and maybe some CSS rules to reorder that single component. Or you can use Flexbox.
</p>
<p class="home-tagline">For this website, I'm not too worried about browser coverage.
  But, if a good portion of my potential visitors were showing up as IE9 through analytics, I would probably reconsider using Flexbox.
</p>
<p class="home-tagline">In my case, a little Flexbox fixed everything.

<pre class="pre">
  .blog-posts-container{
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    .above-fold{
      order: 2;
    }
  }
  .blog-posts-ribbon{
    order: 1;
  }
</pre>
