  <p class="home-tagline">
    Building this website was my first time using Metalsmith, and I must say... I really like it!
    I think there are a few things that I need to improve in my flow
    (like the file watchers -- currently I have to stop Node and restart to rebuild when a collection template or post changes; all other file changes are watched and rebuilt properly).
  </p>
  <p class="home-tagline">
    There has been a few headaches though, namely Metalsmith Collections and working with the underlying data that gets created.  But, for the most part it's been a fun and smooth web building experience and it's helped me get better at tooling and project workflow.
    My existing workflow was a simple gulpfile, and while this is similar, I believe Metalsmith is much more versatile and useful.
  </p>
  <p class="home-tagline">
    I especially love the fact that I can add a simple HTML file that is tagged as a blog post or portfolio post, and the site rebuilds and takes care of itself to link assets together.

    I hope to be making another blog post about using Metalsmith with more in-depth techincal discussions.  Stay tuned.
