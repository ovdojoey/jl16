    Pates Law had asked me to build their first website back in 2012.  The site served them well for some time but it was not mobile responsive and looked seriously dated.
    As PLG is one my leading clients and source of referrals, a proper website for them was a must.  This new site was built on Laravel, is optimized for SEO and is much friendlier on the eyes.
