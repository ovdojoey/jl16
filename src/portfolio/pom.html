  <p class="home-tagline">
    In 2013, Promo Only was using outdated billing software and had no way to effectively process online orders.  I was tasked with building a new online based
    system to replace outdated in-house ordering tools.  Using PHP and the Paypal API, I developed a new system for our sales reps to process orders.
     These tools would later be migrated to the PromoOnly.com website.
