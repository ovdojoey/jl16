This website was built with Metalsmith and uses various plugins to manipulate and generate content.  

Feel free to use the `build.js` file to create your own similar static build using Handlebars, Sass, Autoprefixer, and Uglify.


## USAGE
Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run the Metalsmith API using `node build.js`.

## MODIFICATION
This website is specific to me but feel free to create your own layouts using my same build chain.
